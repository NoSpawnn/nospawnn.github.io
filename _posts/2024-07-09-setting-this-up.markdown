Wow, setting up this blog was WAY more of a pain than it probably should've been. The vast majority of the time was spent trying to get [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) themes to play nice together, which I *finally* realised was because GH Pages uses an old version of Minima; so the `_config.yml` options I was trying to use weren't valid!
