Wow, setting up this blog was WAY more of a pain than it probably should've been. 

The vast majority of the time was spent trying to get [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) themes to play nice together, which I *finally* realised was because GH Pages uses an old version of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima); so the `_config.yml` options I was trying to use weren't valid!

I briefly considered switching to [Astro](https://astro.build/), but found it to be a bit too complex for the simple site I was trying to build, so threw that idea out pretty quickly.

*Now* I've decided to switch to the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme after seeing it on someone elses blog and thinking it looked waaaay better than Minima.

Regardless of some of the issues I had building this static site it's been fun, I remember trying something like this a few years ago, also with Jekyll if I remember right, and had nothing **but** problems trying to get my layouts to look right ~~(which, in hindsight, was definitely entirely my fault)~~ and giving up on the idea. So I'm glad to have this set up now!
